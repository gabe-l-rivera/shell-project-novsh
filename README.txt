In this project, I wrote a shell that allows the user to interactively execute Unix programs. This shell is called the Novel Shell (novsh), which reads commands typed by the user and then executes them accordingly. It also allows users to set variables stored in the shell that can be used in subsequent commands. Novsh is somewhat similar to existing shells such as csh, bash, ksh, and tcsh. However, it lacks much of the functionality found in those shells. It also has a different command syntax and a different command set. This project was inspired and created by Dr. Raphael Finkel, professor at the University of Kentucky, College of Engineering.
